Inspired by https://github.com/eviltester/javaForTestersCode
I suggest you read the book also, it' great book


## Tester us Python differently

By learning the basics of Python presented in this repo, you will learn how to read and understand existing code bases, and even more you can write simple checks using Pytest quickly, it can be applied to creat combination with Selenium for Web automation or using Appium lib for Mobile automation, or Requests lib for API testing. 

### You will not learn how to build and structure an application. 

My aim is to help you start writing automation code using Python, and have the basic knowledge you need to do that. 
This repo focuses on core Python language functionality and Pytest library, since once you have the basics, picking up a library and learning how to use it becomes a matter of reading the documentation and sample code, right? :D
